🏥 **Transforming Clinical Documentation with AI Fine-Tuning**

Excited to share my latest project: building a specialized LLM for **hospital course summarization** using Azure AI Foundry!

**The Challenge:**
Clinical coders spend hours reading lengthy patient notes to create Brief Hospital Course summaries for billing and compliance. This manual process is time-consuming and prone to inconsistencies.

**The Solution:**
I fine-tuned GPT-4o to automatically generate concise, accurate clinical summaries from complex medical documentation.

**Technical Highlights:**
✅ Fine-tuned GPT-4o using Azure AI Foundry  
✅ Built end-to-end pipeline: data prep → training → inference → evaluation  
✅ Created synthetic clinical data generator for training  
✅ Implemented evaluation with ROUGE metrics  
✅ Full Python SDK integration with Azure OpenAI  

**Key Learnings:**
- Fine-tuning significantly improves domain-specific performance
- Azure AI Foundry makes enterprise LLM deployment seamless
- Synthetic data generation is powerful for specialized domains
- Proper evaluation metrics are crucial for healthcare AI

**Impact:**
This automation can potentially save clinical coders hours per patient record while maintaining accuracy and consistency in medical documentation.

**Tech Stack:**
Azure AI Foundry | OpenAI GPT-4o | Python | Azure OpenAI SDK

Always learning, always building! 🚀
