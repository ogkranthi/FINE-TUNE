Initial imaging (abdominal X-ray and CT scan) confirmed dilated small bowel loops with a transition point in the mid-jejunum, without evidence of perforation or ischemia.\n\nOn admission, a nasogastric tube (NGT) was placed for decompression, yielding significant bilious output, and intravenous (IV) fluids were initiated. Pain was managed with IV morphine, and nausea with IV ondansetron. IV ceftriaxone was started on Day 2 for prophylaxis against bacterial translocation. The patient was encouraged to ambulate to prevent deconditioning.\n\nBy Day 3, the patient showed clinical improvement with reduced abdominal distension, decreased NGT output, and the passage of flatus. The NGT was removed, and a trial of clear liquids was initiated, which was well tolerated. Pain management was transitioned to oral acetaminophen.\n\nOver Days 4-6, the patient continued to improve, with resolution of abdominal distension, passage of stool, and toleration of an advanced diet to soft foods. IV fluids were discontinued, and the patient ambulated independently. IV ceftriaxone was completed on Day 6.\n\nThe patient was discharged on Day 7 in stable condition, tolerating a soft diet, with no signs of recurrent obstruction. Discharge instructions included a high-fiber diet, adequate hydration, and follow-up with the primary care provider in one week.", "reference": "The patient, a 38-year-old female, was admitted with a diagnosis of mechanical small bowel obstruction, presenting with severe abdominal pain, nausea, and abdominal distension.

Labs were unremarkable.  \n\nOn admission, a nasogastric tube (NGT) was placed for decompression, yielding significant bilious output. IV fluids (normal saline, later switched to lactated Ringer's) were administered for hydration, and pain was managed with IV morphine and hydromorphone.

The patient was closely monitored with strict intake and output measurements.  \n\nBy Day 3, the patient demonstrated clinical improvement, with reduced abdominal distension, diminished NGT output, and the passage of flatus. The NGT was removed, and a trial of clear liquids was initiated, which was well tolerated. Pain management was transitioned to oral acetaminophen.  \n\nOver Days 4-6, the patient continued to improve, reporting bowel movements and minimal residual pain.
