Initial management included nasogastric tube (NGT) insertion for decompression, IV fluids, and pain control with IV morphine. On Day 1, abdominal X-ray and CT confirmed small bowel obstruction with a transition point in the mid-jejunum, without ischemia or perforation.\n\nBy Day 2, the patient showed slight improvement with reduced abdominal distension and decreased NGT output. IV fluids were switched to Lactated Ringer's, and IV Ceftriaxone was started for prophylaxis. Pain management was adjusted to IV hydromorphone.\n\nOn Day 3, further improvement was noted with diminished abdominal distension and NGT output, and the patient passed flatus. The NGT was removed, and the patient was started on clear liquids, which were well tolerated.\n\nBy Day 4, the patient reported passing flatus and small bowel movements. The diet was advanced to soft foods by Day 5, and IV fluids were discontinued. The patient ambulated independently by Day 6, and IV Ceftriaxone was continued until Day 6.\n\nThe patient was discharged on Day 7 with instructions for a high-fiber diet, adequate hydration, and follow-up with her primary care physician in one week. The hospital course was uncomplicated, and the patient showed progressive improvement with resolution of the bowel obstruction.", "reference": "The patient, a 38-year-old female, was admitted with a diagnosis of mechanical small bowel obstruction, presenting with severe abdominal pain, nausea, and abdominal distension. Initial imaging (X-ray and CT) confirmed moderate small bowel distension with a transition point in the mid-jejunum, without evidence of perforation or ischemia. Labs were unremarkable.  \n\nOn admission, a nasogastric tube (NGT) was placed for decompression, yielding significant bilious output. IV fluids (normal saline, later switched to lactated Ringer's) were administered for hydration, and pain was managed with IV morphine and hydromorphone. Prophylactic IV ceftriaxone was initiated on Day 2 to prevent bacterial translocation. The patient was closely monitored with strict intake and output measurements.  \n\nBy Day 3, the patient demonstrated clinical improvement, with reduced abdominal distension, diminished NGT output, and the passage of flatus. The NGT was removed, and a trial of clear liquids was initiated, which was well tolerated. Pain management was transitioned to oral acetaminophen.  \n\nOver Days 4-6, the patient continued to improve, reporting bowel movements and minimal residual pain. The diet was advanced to soft foods, IV fluids were discontinued, and the patient ambulated independently. IV ceftriaxone was completed on Day 6.  \n\nThe patient was discharged on Day 7 in stable condition, tolerating a soft diet, with resolution of the bowel obstruction. Discharge instructions included a high-fiber diet, adequate hydration, and follow-up with the primary care provider in one week."}
