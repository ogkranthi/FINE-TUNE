Initial management included the insertion of a nasogastric tube (NGT) for bowel decompression, administration of intravenous fluids, and pain control with IV morphine. Imaging confirmed a moderate small bowel obstruction with a transition point in the mid-jejunum, without ischemia or perforation.\n\nOn Day 2, the patient received IV Ceftriaxone for prophylaxis against bacterial translocation. Despite persistent abdominal tenderness, there was a reduction in NGT output and abdominal distension. By Day 3, the patient's condition improved, with reduced pain and NGT output, and the NGT was removed. The patient tolerated clear liquids well and transitioned to oral acetaminophen for pain management.\n\nOver Days 4 to 6, the patient showed continued improvement, passing flatus and small bowel movements by Day 5. The diet was advanced to soft foods, and IV fluids were discontinued.

Initial imaging (X-ray and CT) confirmed moderate small bowel distension with a transition point in the mid-jejunum, without evidence of perforation or ischemia. Labs were unremarkable.  \n\nOn admission, a nasogastric tube (NGT) was placed for decompression, yielding significant bilious output. IV fluids (normal saline, later switched to lactated Ringer's) were administered for hydration, and pain was managed with IV morphine and hydromorphone. Prophylactic IV ceftriaxone was initiated on Day 2 to prevent bacterial translocation. The patient was closely monitored with strict intake and output measurements.  \n\nBy Day 3, the patient demonstrated clinical improvement, with reduced abdominal distension, diminished NGT output, and the passage of flatus. The NGT was removed, and a trial of clear liquids was initiated, which was well tolerated. Pain management was transitioned to oral acetaminophen.  \n\nOver Days 4-6, the patient continued to improve, reporting bowel movements and minimal residual pain. The diet was advanced to soft foods, IV fluids were discontinued, and the patient ambulated independently. IV ceftriaxone was completed on Day 6.  \n\nThe patient was discharged on Day 7 in stable condition, tolerating a soft diet, with resolution of the bowel obstruction. Discharge instructions included a high-fiber diet, adequate hydration, and follow-up with the primary care provider in one week."}
