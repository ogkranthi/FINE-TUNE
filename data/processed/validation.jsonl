Initial management included IV levothyroxine (500 mcg bolus), hydrocortisone (100 mg IV), aggressive warming measures, and hemodynamic support with isotonic saline. Labs revealed severe hypothyroidism (TSH 85 μIU/mL, Free T4 0.2 ng/dL) and respiratory acidosis (pH 7.23, PaCO2 55 mmHg).  \n\nOver the first 24 hours, the patient showed gradual improvement in hemodynamics and mental status with continued IV levothyroxine (100 mcg/day), hydrocortisone (50 mg every 6 hours), and supportive care. By Day 5, the patient was alert and oriented x2, with resolution of hypothermia (97.8°F), bradycardia (68 bpm), and hypotension (118/76 mmHg). Edema significantly improved, and the Foley catheter was removed as the patient resumed independent voiding. Levothyroxine was transitioned to oral administration (150 mcg daily), and hydrocortisone was discontinued.  \n\nBy Day 10, the patient was fully alert and oriented x3, ambulating independently with mild fatigue, and tolerating an oral diet. Vital signs were stable, and laboratory values showed improvement in thyroid function (TSH 12 μIU/mL, Free T4 1.1 ng/dL). The patient was discharged home in stable condition with instructions on thyroid hormone replacement therapy and follow-up with endocrinology in one week. Final diagnoses included myxedema coma and resolved hypothermia."}]}
