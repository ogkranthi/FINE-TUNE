Reports passing flatus and small bowel movements by Day 5. Pain decreased significantly (2-3/10). Abdomen soft, non-tender, mild residual distension.  \n\n**Interventions**:  \n- Advanced diet to soft foods by Day 5.  \n- Discontinued IV fluids.  \n- Continued **Ceftriaxone IV** until Day 6.  \n- Ambulated independently by Day 6.  \n\n**Response**:  \nPatient tolerating oral diet and ambulating independently.

Pain started 4 days ago, progressively worsening, now rated 9/10. Denies vomiting, fever, or prior similar symptoms.  \n\n**ROS**:  \nPositive for abdominal pain, nausea, and bloating. Negative for fever, vomiting, diarrhea, or urinary symptoms.  \n\n**Physical Exam**:  \n- Abdomen: Distended, firm, hypoactive bowel sounds, tenderness in lower quadrants.  \n- Extremities: Normal strength, normal ROM.  \n- Neurologic: Alert and oriented x4.  \n\n**Assessment**: Suspected mechanical bowel obstruction.  \n\n**Plan**:  \n1. Admit to medical ward.  \n2. Place NGT for decompression.  \n3. Start IV fluids (normal saline).  \n4. Pain control: IV morphine PRN.  \n5. Labs: CBC, CMP, lactate. Imaging: abdominal X-ray, CT abdomen/pelvis.  \n6. Consult general surgery if no improvement in 48 hours.  \n\n---\n\n#### **Progress Notes**  \n**Day 3**:  \nPatient showing signs of improvement. NGT output decreased; flatus reported. Abdominal CT confirms mechanical bowel obstruction without evidence of ischemia. Plan to remove NGT and trial clear liquids.  \n\n**Day 5**:  \nPatient progressing well. Passing stool, tolerating oral intake. Plan to advance to soft diet tomorrow if no complications.  \n\n**Discharge Plan (Day 7)**:  \nPatient will be discharged home. Recommend high-fiber diet, hydration, and follow-up with PCP in 1 week.  \n\n---\n\n### RADIOLOGY/LAB RESULTS  \n\n#### **Day 1 - Abdominal X-ray**  \n**Findings**:  \nDilated loops of small bowel with air-fluid levels. No free air under diaphragm.  \n\n---\n\n#### **Day 1 - Abdominal CT Scan**  \n**Findings**:  \nModerate small bowel distension with transition point in mid-jejunum. No evidence of perforation or ischemia.  \n\n---\n\n#### **Lab Results**  \n**Day 1**:  \n- WBC: 9,800/µL  \n- Hemoglobin: 13.6 g/dL  \n- Platelets: 250,000/µL  \n- Sodium: 136 mmol/L  \n- Potassium: 3.8 mmol/L  \n- BUN: 18 mg/dL  \n- Creatinine: 0.9 mg/dL  \n- Lactate: 1.1 mmol/L  \n\n**Day 5**:  \nLabs stable, no abnormalities noted.  \n\n---\n\nThis concludes the clinical documentation for a hospitalized patient with bowel obstruction."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The patient, a 38-year-old female, was admitted with a diagnosis of mechanical small bowel obstruction, presenting with severe abdominal pain, nausea, and abdominal distension. Initial imaging (X-ray and CT) confirmed moderate small bowel distension with a transition point in the mid-jejunum, without evidence of perforation or ischemia. Labs were unremarkable.  \n\nOn admission, a nasogastric tube (NGT) was placed for decompression, yielding significant bilious output. IV fluids (normal saline, later switched to lactated Ringer's) were administered for hydration, and pain was managed with IV morphine and hydromorphone. Prophylactic IV ceftriaxone was initiated on Day 2 to prevent bacterial translocation. The patient was closely monitored with strict intake and output measurements.  \n\nBy Day 3, the patient demonstrated clinical improvement, with reduced abdominal distension, diminished NGT output, and the passage of flatus. The NGT was removed, and a trial of clear liquids was initiated, which was well tolerated. Pain management was transitioned to oral acetaminophen.  \n\nOver Days 4-6, the patient continued to improve, reporting bowel movements and minimal residual pain. The diet was advanced to soft foods, IV fluids were discontinued, and the patient ambulated independently. IV ceftriaxone was completed on Day 6.  \n\nThe patient was discharged on Day 7 in stable condition, tolerating a soft diet, with resolution of the bowel obstruction. Discharge instructions included a high-fiber diet, adequate hydration, and follow-up with the primary care provider in one week."}]}
